# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
In this project, we build a Facebook Prophet machine learning model to forecast the price of Tesla stock for the next 30 days. The project involves data collection, visualization, model building, and performance evaluation using real-time data. We’ll also dive into stock analysis fundamentals and automate the forecasting process for any stock of your choice.

## Key Concepts
- **Facebook Prophet**: A forecasting tool used to predict time series data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating engaging and informative graphs to visualize stock performance.
- **Stock Analysis**: Analyzing key metrics like PE ratio, EPS, Beta, Market Cap, Volume, and Price Range.
- **Automation**: Building an automated pipeline to forecast stock prices with ease.

## Steps Involved

### 1. **Importing Libraries**
   We start by importing all necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Facebook Prophet to work with the data and build the model.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - Download the latest Tesla stock data from **Yahoo Finance**.
   - Prepare the dataset to be used in the forecasting model.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
   - Using **Plotly Express**, we visualize the historical performance of Tesla’s stock.
   - We create interactive graphs and charts that display trends in the stock price over time.

### 4. **Building the Model**
   - Create a **Facebook Prophet** model to forecast the stock price of Tesla 30 days into the future.
   - Train the model using historical stock price data.

### 5. **Evaluating the Model**
   - Compare the model's forecast with real stock data using **Google Finance** in Google Sheets.
   - Evaluate the accuracy of the model’s predictions.

### 6. **Stock Analysis**
   - Analyze key metrics of Tesla’s stock, including:
     - **PE Ratio**
     - **EPS (Earnings Per Share)**
     - **Beta**
     - **Market Cap**
     - **Volume**
     - **Price Range**

### 7. **Automation**
   - Automate the entire forecasting process so that you can upload stock data and get the forecast along with visualizations in just a few seconds.
